Thank you for your interest in this project.

## About This Project

This is a personal project shared openly. I actively welcome bug reports and suggestions for improvements, but I retain sole responsibility for development and decision-making. Think of it as “shared but not collaborative”: your feedback is valued and can influence the direction, but implementation is up to me.

Please note that responses and changes may take time, as I maintain this project alongside other personal commitments.

## Issues

If you believe you have found a bug, please first check existing issues (including closed ones) to avoid duplicates. If none exists, feel free to open a new issue using the relevant form.

## Feature Requests

If you have ideas to improve the project, please check for existing discussions. If it is a new idea, you are encouraged to open an issue.

Keep in mind this project is designed to meet my personal needs. I may not pursue ideas that do not align with my use cases or would require disproportionate effort. Of course, you are always welcome to fork and adapt the project for your own needs.

## Pull Requests

To keep the codebase consistent and manageable, I do not accept pull requests. Any submitted PRs will be closed without merging.

Thank you for understanding.
