# Security Policy

This project is a personal endeavour and does not operate under a formal vulnerability disclosure program.

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, please open a regular issue to notify me (without disclosing exploit details publicly). If appropriate, I may follow up privately.

Please understand that there is no guaranteed response time or fix schedule. This project is maintained in a personal capacity and may not meet the security expectations of commercial or enterprise software.

There is no private security mailing list or bug bounty program associated with this project.
