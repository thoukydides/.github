# Security Policy

This project is a personal endeavor and does not have a formal security vulnerability reporting process.

If you believe that you have discovered a vulnerability, please open a regular issue to bring it to my attention (without including any sensitive exploit details in public). If appropriate I may follow up privately.

Please understand there is no guarantee of immediate action or specific timelines. This project is maintained in my personal capacity and may not meet the security standards of commercial software.
