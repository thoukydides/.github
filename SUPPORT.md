# Support

Thank you for using this project; I appreciate your interest and hope you find it useful.

## How to Get Help

This is a personal project, developed and maintained in my spare time. Whilst I am happy to share it and welcome feedback, please understand that the support I can offer is limited and best-effort.

**Before opening a new request, please:**

* Review the `README.md` for setup and usage information.
* Check the *Wiki* (if available) for additional documentation.
* Search existing *Issues* and *Discussions* (including closed ones) to see if your question has already been answered or the issue reported.

**For bug reports or feature suggestions:**

* Open a new *Issue* using the appropriate template.
* Please include:
  * A clear description of the problem or idea.
  * Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
  * Relevant version numbers (e.g. project version, OS, runtime).
  * What you expected to happen, and what actually happened.

**For general questions or help requests:**

* Start a new *Discussion* on GitHub.

## Scope of Support

**What I aim to provide:**

* Fixes for confirmed bugs within the scope of the project.
* Consideration of feature requests that align with my use cases.
* Clarifications where documentation is incomplete or unclear.

**What’s outside scope (or only offered on a best-effort basis):**

* **Guaranteed response times or urgent fixes:** I maintain this around other personal commitments.
* **One-on-one debugging or personalised support:** I cannot offer deep troubleshooting for individual setups unless it is a reproducible bug.
* **Support for forks or custom modifications:** Feel free to fork the project, but support for your version is your responsibility.
* **Requests beyond the project’s purpose or scope:** Especially for features I do not personally need or use.

## Expectations

As the sole developer, I maintain this project based on my own needs and interests, while trying to make it useful for others too. I welcome constructive, thoughtful feedback. Issue reports that help improve the core experience are especially appreciated.

Thanks again for your interest and support!
